Webpage Stage2 - Dom

Update the already existing HTML and CSS page to use the DOM (https://github.com/paulobravo74/pb3d). It is not 100% responsive at the moment, but it is not my priority as it is an exercise to practice JavaScript. The slides, albums, their respective photos, and also the videos are dynamically created. I am also not concerned about the final layout. The next step will be updating it to jQuery.
